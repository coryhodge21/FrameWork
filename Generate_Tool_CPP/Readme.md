# TODO's

- Fix Main loop to take arg's as input so multiple files
    can be parsed in one run

- Create project common h file for defines 

- Update File Writer to generate module enums for registers

- verify memory desctruction, valgrind or similiar

- increase flexibility in data used as input, right now only lines with
    #defines are parsed

- add masking shifts for write() functions, currently you have to know the offset of an enum to properly write, this needs changed
